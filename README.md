# Doctor-Prescription-Label-Reading

## Introduction

Handwritten prescriptions from doctors are still a common practice in many healthcare settings. However, these prescriptions can be difficult to read, leading to errors in medication administration and potentially jeopardizing patient safety. Automating the process of reading and interpreting these prescriptions could significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of medication management.


## Objectives:

The main objective of this research project is to develop a system that can accurately read and interpret handwritten prescriptions from doctors. Specifically, the proposed proposed aims to:

- Develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize and classify different handwritten characters and symbols on prescriptions.
- Implement a natural language processing (NLP) component that can understand the meaning of the text and extract relevant information, such as the name of the medication and the dosage instructions.
- Test the performance of the system on a large dataset of real-world prescriptions to ensure its accuracy and robustness.

## Methods:

To achieve the above objectives, the following methods will be employed (You may add your Methods too):

 - [Data collection](): A large dataset of handwritten prescriptions will be collected from various healthcare settings. 
      - This dataset will be used to train and test the machine learning model.

- [Data preprocessing](): The collected data will be preprocessed to remove noise and ensure that it is suitable for training the machine learning model. 
    - This can involve techniques such as cropping, resizing, and thresholding to extract the handwritten text from the prescriptions.

 - [Feature extraction](): In this step, relevant features from the preprocessed data will be extracted. 
     - These features will be used to train the machine learning model. 
     - Commonly used features for handwriting recognition tasks include pixel values, gradient information, and contour information.

- [Model training](): A machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), will be trained on the preprocessed data to recognize and classify different handwritten characters and symbols to generate automatic reports.
     -  The model will be trained using a supervised learning approach, where the correct class labels are provided for the training data.
 
 - [Model evaluation](): The trained model will be evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and robustness. 
    - Common evaluation metrics for handwriting recognition tasks include accuracy, precision, and recall.
 
  - [NLP component](): An NLP component will be implemented to understand the meaning of the text on the prescriptions and extract relevant information.
    - This can be achieved using techniques such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.

- [System Evaluation](): The performance of the system will be evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and robustness in reading and interpreting handwritten prescriptions..

- [Fine-tuning and optimization](): If the performance of the system is not satisfactory, the model and NLP component can be fine-tuned and optimized to improve their performance. 
   - This can involve adjusting the model architecture, changing the training parameters, and adding more data to the training set.

- [Deployment](): Once the system has been developed and tested, it can be deployed in a real-world setting to read and interpret handwritten prescriptions from doctors.

 ## Expected outcomes:

- It is expected that the proposed project aims to develop an automated system that can accurately read and interpret handwritten prescriptions from doctors, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of medication management. 

- The successful implementation of this system will also have the potential to significantly improve patient safety by reducing the incidence of medication errors, which can have serious consequences for patients.


## Datasets 

There are several sources where we can obtain datasets for the above project:

- [Publicly available datasets](): There are several publicly available datasets that you can use for the project which contains handwritten text.

- [Crowdsourced datasets](): Another option is to create a crowdsourced dataset by asking people to contribute their handwritten prescriptions. This can be done through online platforms or by recruiting participants through a study.
  - A croudsourced website to collect various data points to create datasets for research works/projects.

- [Healthcare organizations](): You can also try reaching out to healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and clinics, to see if they are willing to share their datasets of handwritten prescriptions.

- [Data aggregators](): There are also companies that specialize in aggregating and selling datasets for machine learning projects. These datasets may come at a cost, but they can be a convenient source for obtaining large amounts of high-quality data.

*Regardless of the source, it is important to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios in which the system will be used, and that appropriate ethical and privacy considerations are taken into account.*
