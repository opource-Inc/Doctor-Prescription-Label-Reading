# Doctor-Prescription-Label-Reading

## Introduction

Handwritten prescriptions from doctors are still a common practice in many healthcare settings. However, these prescriptions can be difficult to read, leading to errors in medication administration and potentially jeopardizing patient safety. Automating the process of reading and interpreting these prescriptions could significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of medication management.


## Objectives:

The main objective of this research project is to develop a system that can accurately read and interpret handwritten prescriptions from doctors. Specifically, the proposed proposed aims to:

- Develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize and classify different handwritten characters and symbols on prescriptions.
- Implement a natural language processing (NLP) component that can understand the meaning of the text and extract relevant information, such as the name of the medication and the dosage instructions.
- Test the performance of the system on a large dataset of real-world prescriptions to ensure its accuracy and robustness.

## Methods:

To achieve the above objectives, the following methods will be employed (You may add your Methods too):

 - [Data collection](): A large dataset of handwritten prescriptions will be collected from various healthcare settings. 
      - This dataset will be used to train and test the machine learning model.
 - [Data preprocessing](): The collected data will be preprocessed to remove noise and ensure that it is suitable for training the machine learning model.
 - [Model training](): A machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), will be trained on the preprocessed data to recognize and classify different handwritten characters and symbols to generate automatic reports.
 - [NLP component](): An NLP component will be implemented to understand the meaning of the text on the prescriptions and extract relevant information.
 - [Evaluation](): The performance of the system will be evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and robustness.
 
 ## Expected outcomes:

- It is expected that the proposed project aims to develop an automated system that can accurately read and interpret handwritten prescriptions from doctors, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of medication management. 

- The successful implementation of this system will also have the potential to significantly improve patient safety by reducing the incidence of medication errors, which can have serious consequences for patients.
